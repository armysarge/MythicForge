# Dice UI
Dice User Interface

## Purpose
Dice UI provides a library of front-end components for use with [Dice Box](https://github.com/3d-dice/dice-box). These are modules are designed to be stand-alone without dependencies on each other. Add only the modules you want to your dice roller. For instructions on how to use a specific module, see the readme file under that module's directory.
